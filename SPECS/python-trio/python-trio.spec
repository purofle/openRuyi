%description
The Trio project produces an async/await-native I/O library for
Python. Like all async libraries, its main purpose is to help write
programs that do multiple things at the same time with parallelized
I/O, such as a web spider that wants to fetch lots of pages in
parallel, a web server that needs to juggle lots of downloads and
websocket connections at the same time, a process supervisor
monitoring multiple subprocesses. Compared to other libraries, Trio
has an obsessive focus on usability and correctness.
